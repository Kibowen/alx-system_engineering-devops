# Caching problem.
## Issue Summary:
    Impact: The online shopping platform experienced intermittent downtime and significant performance degradation, affecting approximately 35% of users. Users faced slow page loading times, inability to complete purchases, and intermittent errors during their browsing sessions.
## Timeline:
* June 12, 2023, 10:15 AM (PST): The issue was detected when   monitoring systems reported a sudden increase in error rates and latency.
* The operations team was alerted through automated monitoring alerts.
* Actions were taken to investigate the root cause of the issue, focusing on the web server, database, and external APIs.
* Misleading investigation paths included a suspected issue with the external payment gateway and a potential database bottleneck.
* The incident was escalated to the engineering and infrastructure teams for further analysis and resolution.
June 12, 2023, 11:30 AM (PST): The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the caching layer of the application.
Root Cause and Resolution:
* The root cause of the service outage and performance degradation was traced back to an incorrect configuration in the caching layer. The misconfiguration led to a significant increase in cache misses, resulting in excessive database queries and subsequent delays in serving user requests.

To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:

* The caching configuration was corrected to ensure proper cache utilization.
* The cache was cleared to eliminate any inconsistent or outdated data.
* Additional monitoring was implemented to track cache hit rates and identify any future misconfigurations promptly.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

* Regular configuration reviews will be conducted to identify potential misconfigurations in critical components.
* Enhanced monitoring and alerting mechanisms will be established to detect cache-related issues and anomalies in real time.
* A comprehensive incident response plan will be developed to streamline the escalation and resolution processes.
* Thorough testing and validation procedures will be implemented to verify the correctness of configuration changes before deployment.

Tasks to address the issue:

* Review and update caching configurations across all environments to align with best practices.
* Develop automated tests to verify the effectiveness of cache configurations and ensure proper utilization.
* Enhance monitoring systems to include cache hit/miss rates, latency, and error rates for early detection of cache-related issues.
* Conduct training sessions for operations and engineering teams on cache management and troubleshooting.
* Document and communicate the incident response plan, emphasizing the steps to identify and resolve misconfigurations promptly.

In conclusion, the service outage and performance degradation were caused by a misconfiguration in the caching layer. Through prompt detection, investigation, and correction of the misconfiguration, the issue was resolved, and measures were established to prevent similar incidents in the future. The incident highlighted the importance of rigorous configuration management and proactive monitoring to ensure the stability and reliability of the online shopping platform.
